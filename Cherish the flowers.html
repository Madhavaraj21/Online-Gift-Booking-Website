If you are an emotional person and keep all the stuff with you given by your loved ones. Dig into this post and know all the things you should know about how to preserve flowers.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger; color:red;">Let's Jump on the Drying Methods</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">Flowers can be dried at home in simple ways in a microwave, using a desiccant or in the air. Another method of drying flowers is the freeze-drying method, but this can’t be done at home as the normal freezer would not work. Special freezers are required and take a couple of weeks. If you are planning to start a flower drying business, then only you should think of this option.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger; color:red;">Steps to Prepare Your Flowers For Drying</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">Dried flowers are fragile and need to be handled with care. Fully open blooms have a high chance of losing their petals after they get dry. To get the best result, you need roses that still haven’t started to decay, and leaves are not falling off. If you want your roses to keep their colour during the dying process, don’t forget to expose them to light. If you are getting roses from the garden or from a florist, make sure to pick them up early in the morning when there is no moisture on the petals. Always try to get your hands on fresh and healthy roses and you don’t want any discoloration or rotting during the process of drying them. If you are thinking of preserving roses with steam, you need to remove all the leaves as they will not dry well with them.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger; color:red;">Air Drying the Petals</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">This is one of the most common methods of drying flowers. It does not require anything except flowers and is probably the easiest as well. This method will be best for just opened rosebuds that still have their shape. Hang the flowers like your laundry with blooms facing the ground. Before hanging the flowers, don’t forget to clear all the water trapped between the petals. To get the best result, dry your flowers in a dry, warm and dark place with a good ventilation system. Let them hang for 2-3 weeks. Once the flowers are dried, remove them from the string and spray them with colorless hairspray to protect them.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger; color:red;">Air Drying in a Vase</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">You can dry your flowers by leaving them in a vase if you are drying miniature roses or spray roses. Make sure that you take out water from the vase as you don’t want your roses to rotting. If the climate is hot, water will evaporate quickly, so it will not make a difference. Spray the rose with hairspray. The hairspray keeps the petals firm and prevents them from slumping while hanging upside down.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger; color:red;">Use Microwave to Dry the Roses</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">This method is quick and easy. Get a greaseproof paper and place your flowers. Place your flowers on paper and set the microwave to the lowest setting. you've got to check on roses every 45 -60 seconds as you don’t want them to overcook</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger; color:red;">Preserving of Roses with Silica Gel</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">Even after drying you want your flower to look natural, try using silica gel. This method works best for fully open roses. Place your flowers in a large container, preferably airtight, and bury them in silica gel. Cover the roses gently in the gel until every part of the flower is concealed. In the next step, seal the container tightly. After a few weeks gently uncover vibrant preserved flowers. The amount of silica will be needed according to the number of flowers.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger; color:red;">Flower Pressing</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">Use the pressed method if you want to use dried flowers for more than flower arranging. Line the pages with wax paper of a heavy book then arrange flowers face down to avoid overlapping. Close the book and apply some pressure to it. Leave it for around a month. After there will be no moisture you will see a papery texture. Pressed flowers are in trend these days. They are used in stationery, bookmarks, or fill a picture frame for vintage wall art.</p>
